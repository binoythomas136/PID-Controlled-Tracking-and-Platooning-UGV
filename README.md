# PID-controlled-Tracking-and-Platooning-UAV
The objective of the project is to design an Unmanned vehicle for tracking a line using the PID
control algorithm. The project consisted of 3 tasks. The first task was to track a path using the PID
controller. The second task was collision avoidance where we stopped the bot as close
to the block as possible. The third task was platooning in which we used our bot us to follow another bot at
a constant distance of 20 cm.
The UV was designed using the LEGO EV3 brick and motors and
the light sensors used in this project were EESF5-B and the ultrasonic sensor was the SRF05.
